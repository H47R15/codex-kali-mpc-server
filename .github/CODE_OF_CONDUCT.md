# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want the Kali Security MCP Server community to be a safe, collaborative, and welcoming space. As contributors and maintainers we pledge to make participation in the project and our ecosystem a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experience levels
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Showing responsibility when working with potentially sensitive security tooling

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment or doxxing
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repos, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other channel used for project communication. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces, such as using an official social media account or presenting at an event.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers as soon as possible. You can reach us by:

- Emailing the contact address listed in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- Mentioning or directly messaging `@H47R15` on GitHub if email is not an option

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly. We respect the privacy and security of reporters and those involved in an incident. Information will only be shared with the people who need to know in order to take action.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these community-impact guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** — A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and explaining why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. **Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
3. **Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
4. **Permanent Ban** — A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.
